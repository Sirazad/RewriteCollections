# RewriteCollections
As a practice some of the Collection Framework elements are rewritten 

## HashTable
Entry and HashTable must be generic to accept K and V
List is the only Collection type usable as help 

## ArrayList
Build an ArrayList from scratch

## LinkedList
Build  linkedList from scratch

## Refactoring ArrayList and LinkedList to optimise performance
Given a set up for ArrayList and LinkedList - rewrite the methods to match the test case requirements.
